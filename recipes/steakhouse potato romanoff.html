    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>Honestly I just learned what this is, I just found that is has potatoes and cheese and it looks like lasagna so it has to be good. Potatoes + sour cream + cheddar cheese
        what could go wrong?
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Shallots</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to make it</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Bake and Chill potatoes</strong></li>
            <p>Wrap each potato in foil and place on a baking sheet. Use a knife to poke holes in the potatoes, then bake until the potatoes are tender and easily pierced with a fork. 
            Allow the potatoes to cool completely, unwrap, and place on a plate. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
            </p>
        <li><strong>Shred Potatoes</strong></li>
            <p>Use a cheese grater to shred the (skin-on) potatoes into a large bowl. Add shallots, seasonings, and cheese. Mix well. 
            Add sour cream and stir until just-combined.
            </p>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong></li>
            <p>Transfer the potato mixture to a buttered casserole dish. Pat it down lightly. Bake until the potatoes are hot and the top is browned.</p>
    </ol>
